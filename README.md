# Progrescrow

A web3 application that is the future of crypto invoicing for creators.
In this project we utilized the `Request Network` and build a project on top of the invoicing example.

Branches:

- main - simple MVP
- justin - concept designs to show the potential future mobile version

# Stack

## Inspiration

Our most fantastic team in the world met at this hackathon. While we were talking about the problems we have with paying by clients for our work, it turned out that we all have the same problems.

1. Currently, there is no consistent framework for digital creators to divide projects into stages and manage them in a transparent manner.
2. Invoicing for different project stages can be incredibly complicated, leading to payment delays and frustration for both creators and their clients.
3. In today's world, cyber threats are a real concern. Creators need tools that provide security for their work and deliver transparency for the payment process.
   Our application, "Progrescrow," allows digital creators to easily split their projects into stages, track progress, and generate automatic invoices for each of these stages. Leveraging Request Network blockchain technology, we ensure the security and immutability of data, eliminating the risk of fraud and enhancing transaction transparency. As a result, "Progrescrow" addresses project management and invoicing challenges for digital creators.

## What it does

Web application that allows to:
hire freelancers
define milestones
pay for partial project completion
supports crypto payments

## Challenges we ran into

Our biggest challenge was the short time to implement the idea. The new Request Network environment in which we created our application was perfect for this task. Work until the last minutes resulted in a working MVP and a mockup of the future mobile version!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we managed to manage the team and divide the tasks accordingly. If it wasn't for that, it would be hard to fit in time with everything we wanted to present.

## What we learned

We learned about the exciting offering at Request Network. Except that each member of our team learned new competences from the others. We got to know a number of new applications and workflows.
Working as a team to deploy the contracts and integrating the front end and backend to develop the App in a short time showed us that building on the blockchain can have great utility.
We learned that if we use the right resources we can continue to learn and become better at this and be successful, using documentation, the discord server, youtube content, and Request Network contacts on discord for any questions.

## What's next for Progrescrow

We want to do tests on a test group. improve usability and simplify the interface. In addition, based on the presented mockup, we want to build a fully functional mobile application.
